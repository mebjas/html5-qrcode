# Html5-Qrcode testing

Testing is very limited at the moment. As we moved from javascript based code to Typescript all the tests were cleaned up. Expecting to write high coverage unit tests for all the source code over time.

If you are interested in contrbuting to the project, adding unit tests would be a great way to get comfortable with the codebase and would be highly impactful for the reliability and stability of the project.

## Testing goals
