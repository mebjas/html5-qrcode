# Html5-Qrcode testing

Testing is broken at the moment as we shifted from pure `Javascript` based
implementation to `Typescript` based implementation. Testing is currently WIP
and tracked in [issue#205](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/205).

## Testing goals
    - [ ] `P1` Unit tests
        - [ ] High coverage
            - [ ] `P1` Coverage > 70%
            - [ ] `P2` Coverage > 80%
            - [ ] `P3` Coverage > 90%
        - [ ] Add integration for code coverage
        - [ ] Integrate code coverage with Codacy
    - [ ] `P2` Browser based e2e testing
