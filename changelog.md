### Version 1.0.7
 + Fixed the video size issue in [issues/21](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/21)
 + Removed fixed height of viewfinder, now the height is based on the video stream. The width is honored if the input element has a default width. Otherwise default width is applied.
 + If `config.qrbox` is greater than derived height, the config is ignored & no shading is applied.
 + The sequence of steps have changed
    + First we get the video feed from the selected camera
    + Then we render video
    + Then based on the height of the video we set the canvas and start scanning.
 + For file scanning, if the container element has some height or width both are honored. 
    Otherwise default width is applied and height is derived from the image.
